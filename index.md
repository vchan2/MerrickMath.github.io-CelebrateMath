Welcome to the celebration of learning **challenge** 2020. Through this challenge your mathematical skills will be put to the test. Problems contained in the maze cover topics from kindergarten mathematics to advanced topics in calculus, probability, number theory, and more. How far will you get? 

For each grade, the winner will receive something REAL COOL of YOUR CHOICE from Master Aaron. In the event of a tie the individual who reaches the highest level **FIRST** is declared the winner.   

To submit how far you make it through the maze, please fill out this form: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/cosmos2020challenge">https://tinyurl.com/cosmos2020challenge</a>. You do **not** need to submit at every level, only the highest level you achieve. You may submit as many times as you wish. 

**Scores will be finalized ~~Friday, June 12~~ Monday, June 15 at 3:30 pm** (Dr. Renert has issued an extension to this challenge so that people can work on it during the weekend!)

Let the adventure begin:
